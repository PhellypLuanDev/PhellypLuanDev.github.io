            <h1>7 Years Canção de Lukas Graham</h1>
        <p>once, I was seven years old, my mama told me
            "Go make yourself some friends, or you'll be lonely"
            Once, I was seven years old
            It was a big-big world, but we thought we were bigger
            Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
            By 11, smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
            Never rich, so we were out to make that steady figure
            Once, I was 11 years old, my daddy told me
            "Go get yourself a wife, or you'll be lonely"
            Once, I was 11 years old
            I always had that dream like my daddy before me
            So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
            Something about the glory just always seemed to bore me
            'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me
            Once, I was 20 years old, my story got told
            Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
            Once, I was 20 years old
            </p>
